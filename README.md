# image-gallery-p2

reflection:
Really enjoyed working on the project, wanted to add alot of personality to this one and include things i really enjoy. had a lot of fun formatting and position everything to work on wide screen or small. Really happy with the added audio i managed to get attached to each image, think that adds a fun extra to the gallery. Part i found the most difficult was parts of the code in java-script, found myself getting mixed up with some of the code. Spent the weekend reading though the resources and feel alot more confident with this already.
